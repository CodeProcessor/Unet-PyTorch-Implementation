# Unet-PyTorch-Implementation

### Introduction

This code base is developed to implement the UNet architecture for image segmentation
using Pytorch framework.

### Introduction to Unet Architecture

The Unet architecture consists of a contracting path to capture
context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. 
Authors show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from 
very few images and outperforms the prior best methods.
